# Employee Directory

The goal of this project was to create a web application that simulates that of an employee directory with several specific requirements:

* Add a new user to the directory
* Find out if a user exists by name
* Update a user's personal information
* Remove a user from the directory
* View the current directory

Libraries used include:
* DOM.js - an ultra-minified version of jQuery
* Clear.css - a CSS3 browser default reset stylesheet
* APP.js - all of the javascript logic for the page
